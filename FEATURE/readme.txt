1. SPE feature systems
- Feature files in this folder have two additional columns ('consonantal' and 'syllabic') to the existing (i.e., pre-2020) SPE features.
- Rhotic vowels were removed as the SPE book did not cover them.
- Featural specifications in xx2spe.feature are aligned to ipa2spe.feature as the baseline (i.e., each segment in transcription systems was first translated to IPA and then values are given following ipa2spe).
- anything2spe.xlsx provides all information including where to find justification for each valuation and correspondence between each transcription system and IPA.

2. Hayes feature systems
- Rhotic vowels are specified as suggested in Hayes (2008, p. 99)
- Several corrections were made on feature values to align with the Hayes textbook.
- Featural specifications in xx2hayes.feature are aligned to ipa2hayes.feature as the baseline (i.e., each segment in transcription systems was first translated to IPA and then values are given following ipa2hayes).
- anything2hayes.xlsx provides all information including where to find justification for each valuation, and correspondence between each transcription system and IPA.
